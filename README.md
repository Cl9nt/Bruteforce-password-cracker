 # Brute-Force Password Cracker

 **About:**

A repository with brute force password cracker I have personally written in Python 3 programming language. 

 ## About these program.

A brute force program attempts every possible solution when cracking a password.
This is not just useful for hacking but can be applicable in many programs. 
This is often inefficient and time consuming because its so thorough.

The algorithm generally use recursion, where the function creates more instances of itself.
There is slight overhead here because if one function finishes, the others still run a few times before realizing they should quit, but if you have a recommendation on how to do it without recursion create an issue!.

 ## Application 

I have used brute-force techniques many times.
Here are some examples where brute forcing could be used:
 - Finding anagrams of a word and seeing which are in a dictionary.
 - Games where the computer needs to analyze the game board and rank the best places to play. 
 - Testing the performance of a language:
   - Benchmarking your CPU.
   - Running a function 10 million times and ranking the performance/output.

 ## Implementation:

Implementation is easy enough.
It contains a small `main` function and references the brute forcing function, which you could just copy into your code.
